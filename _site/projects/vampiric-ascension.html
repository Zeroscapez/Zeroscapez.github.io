  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Vampiric Ascension was developed as an exploration of bullet hell design principles, with a focus on replicating and understanding the mechanics that define the <em>Touhou Project</em> series. The project emphasizes precision movement, readable bullet density, and player reward through a grazing system that balances tension and flow.
  </p>
  <p>
    Built in Unity for Bullet Hell Jam 6, the game integrates a multi-phase boss AI, infinite scrolling backgrounds, and a tightly tuned player controller to maintain responsiveness during high-intensity sequences.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal was to capture the essence of danmaku gameplay — clarity within chaos — while building a solid foundation for scalable enemy and bullet system design.

  <h2>Graze Mechanic Breakdown</h2>
  <p>
    One of my goals with <em>Vampiric Ascension</em> was to capture the thrill of the Graze mechanic from the <em>Touhou Project</em> series — rewarding players for narrowly dodging bullets without taking damage. In researching how Touhou handled this, I found that players could actually touch bullets visually and still count it as a graze. That meant I needed a more nuanced detection system than a single collider could offer.
  </p>
  <p>
    To achieve this, I built a two-collider system around the player: an outer collider for grazing detection and an inner one for actual hits. When a bullet enters the outer collider, it's tracked in a <code>HashSet</code> until it either hits the player or exits safely. If it exits without colliding with the inner hitbox, it's marked as a graze and rewards the player with score and energy. This setup efficiently handles bullet tracking and perfectly recreates that tense, rewarding feeling of brushing past danger — a small risk that pays off in style and satisfaction.

# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello! I’m **Agyei Lomini**, a game developer with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Game Design and Development from Georgia State University. My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in coding, problem-solving, and creating interactive experiences. I’m passionate about using this knowledge to build immersive games that captivate and engage players.

On this site, you’ll find my game development projects, the skills I’ve gained, and some of my experiences in the field.

## Inverse ([Link](https://crestoriashiro.itch.io/inverse){:target="_blank"})

Inverse was our teamâ€™s entry for Beginner Game Jam 2025, it came in #67th place out of 129 entries. The challenge centered on the theme of reflection, inspiring us to create a unique gameplay experience where a character and their mirrored counterpart must work together to unravel puzzles based on light refraction. By manipulating beams of light and their reflective properties, players are encouraged to think collaboratively and creatively to navigate through increasingly challenging levels, uncovering hidden paths and secrets along the way.
<br><br>
My contribution to this project was implenting major mechanics and features, like the light refraction system and swapping system. This involved tracking and maintating multiple instances of data and stopping/starting this stream when neccesary. I also served as director and lead developer on this project.

Starforce Sim is an in development attempt at recreating the combat systems and battle styles found within the Megaman Starforce game series. 
<br><br>
The goal of this project is too breakdown and recreate iconic systems found within the megaman starforce games, I am in charge with implementing the combat system, this includes the battle card system ( a system that involves containg and accessing the data on complex entites that involve things like area of effect, and damage values.), the movement system and the scoring system.

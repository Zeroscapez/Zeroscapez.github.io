## About Me

**Hello! I'm Agyei Lomini, a game developer with a background in Computer Science and Game Design.**  
I specialize in **gameplay programming, systems architecture, and AI development**, with hands-on experience using Unity and C#. My strengths lie in **problem-solving, rapid prototyping, and building scalable systems** that support engaging player experiences.  

Currently, Iâ€™m leading development on a **large-scale indie project**, applying skills in state machines, combat design, and technical systems integration. Alongside this, I build smaller prototypes to experiment with new mechanics, refine workflows, and expand my technical toolkit.  

Iâ€™m passionate about **collaborating with teams** to transform design ideas into polished, interactive experiences, and Iâ€™m always eager to take on challenges that push both my creativity and engineering skills.
